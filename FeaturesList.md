**Easy to use**

> No big learning effort required to know how you instrument your code. All you have is to understand the concept of three keywords : Activity, Task and Worker. With these you can model your situations by marking the target regions, suspect actors in them and have Potato Observer easily visualize their interactions for you.

**Instant Analysis**

With the ease of simple clicks, you select the feature/group of features you target along with the desired analysis operation then have the result instantly plotted in the main area chart.

**Optimization Tracking**

To visualize your optimization effect, just preserve the instrumentation code between code change then open the diiferent set of data altogether and instantly apply any compare operation involving one or many features.

**Advanced Visualization**


All visualizations occur in a powerful chart that shows you checkpoints in form of splines, time periods or stages in colunms, feature-feature interaction in stacked columns or Pie view, multiset tests in columns with stacked grouping,etc.
