  * [Basic tutorial](BasicTutorial.md) This is a basic use case. Read the story about Jeff and his two developers Bob and Dick as they try to solve a particular performance problem. Thanks to this article you can already have a basic idea about the application architecture, andthe kind of resultit can deliver to you.
  * [Avdanced tutorial](AdvancedTutorial.md) In this advanced use case, the aim is to show you how Easy profiler can be used to model a complex code architecture. Furthermore, the article details the different stages needed to have the final profiling results. It shows the pertinence of the analysis/compare tools and the results they deliver when your previous instrumentation code describe well your code architecture.
